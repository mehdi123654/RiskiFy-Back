management provides a standard for project management practitioners and stakeholders defining the aspects of project risk management that are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time it is globally applicable and consistently applied the standard has a descriptive purpose and includes the role of project risk management in project management good risk management practice critical success factors for project risk management the document describes processes activities inputs and outputs for project risk management providing information on what the significant process is what it does why it is significant when it should be performed and who should perform the process it does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented the practice standard for project risk management focuses on risk management for individual projects and is based on chapter of the pmbok guide fourth edition it is organized into three main sections introductory material on the framework and principles of project risk management principles underlying the six project risk management processes and a glossary of terms the six processes are plan risk management identify risks perform qualitative risk analysis perform quantitative risk analysis plan risk responses and monitor and control risks each process is described in terms of its purpose and objectives critical success factors tools and techniques and documentation the practice standard emphasizes fundamental principles of effective and comprehensive project risk management risk management involves principles that have stability and persistence over time although tools and techniques may evolve the approach to risk management can vary depending on the project organization and situation and should be tailored to the project and organizational culture risk management principles can be applied to global projects with diverse business and organizational arrangements and crosscultural teams the principles of project risk management as defined in the pmbok guide fourth edition include risk management planning identification analysis responses and monitoring and control the objectives of project risk management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events and to be used as a check for an organizations processes validating them against good practice risk management is an essential part of project management included in project plans and operational documents to be integrated in every aspect of managing the project it aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence and provide actionoriented information to project managers project risk is an uncertain event or condition that can have a positive or negative effect on project objectives which include scope schedule cost and quality risk management considers events that may or may not occur described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence and their impact on objectives it addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions extending other project management processes such as project scheduling it is not a substitute for other project management processes but builds upon and provides more realistic information considering the uncertainty in the project project risk management involves performing other project management processes such as scheduling budgeting and change management at the best practices level while adding a risk perspective to their outputs it helps estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves needed for risk response actions to meet project objectives early in a projects life cycle risk exposure is high and information on project risks is minimal a risk management approach is applicable throughout the projects life cycle with risks recognized and managed as early as possible as the project plan becomes set the balance between project flexibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be optimized project risk management involves monitoring changes in the project to identify new risks and assess the continued plausibility of existing risks it provides realistic expectations for project completion dates and costs even when future changes are limited riskrelated lessons are reviewed throughout the project and during closure to support organizational learning and continuous improvement of risk management practices project risk management should be conducted in a manner consistent with organizational practices and policies and appropriate to the project it should take into account the business challenges and multicultural environment of a global setting including joint venture projects and dispersed stakeholders changes resulting from project risk management may require decisions at the appropriate level of management including reassigning personnel modifying budgets interacting with regulators and complying with rules of accounting and law project risk management should be conducted in compliance with internal and external requirements project risk management should be conducted ethically with characteristics such as honesty responsibility professionalism and fair dealing effective risk management benefits from communication and consultation with stakeholders to ensure realistic and objective risk identification analysis and response and to avoid political or unreasonable influences the degree of resources time and attention dedicated to risk management should be proportionate to the projects characteristics and value each risk management process should be scaled to the project and reviewed periodically success factors for risk management include recognizing the value of risk management risk management is a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational management project stakeholders project management and team members it requires individual commitment and responsibility from all project participants and stakeholders open and honest communication is crucial for effective project risk management and organizational commitment can be established if it is aligned with the organizations goals and values the effort put into risk management should be scaled to the projects value level of risk scale and other organizational constraints it should be integrated with other project management processes for successful execution the principles of project risk management should be applied based on the specifics of a project and the organizational environment risk management provides benefits when implemented according to good practice principles and with organizational commitment it involves making decisions and performing actions in an open and unbiased manner the relevant information about risk management from the provided section is as follows project risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives the definition of project risk includes two key dimensions uncertainty and effect on a projects objectives when assessing the importance of a project risk both uncertainty and impact must be considered uncertainty can be described using the term probability and the effect can be called impact project risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described and more general conditions which are less specific but also may give rise to uncertainty the definition of project risk encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a projects objectives as well as those which could have a positive effect these two types of risk are called respectively threats and opportunities it is important to address both threats and opportunities in project risk management risk management involves dealing with uncertainties that may or may not occur in the future and could impact project objectives risks should be distinguished from riskrelated features such as causes and effects causes are existing events or circumstances that may give rise to risks while effects are conditional future events or conditions that would directly affect project objectives if the associated risk occurs it is helpful to consider project risk at two levels individual risks and overall project risk individual risks are specific events or conditions that might affect project objectives and can be positively or negatively impactful managing individual risks can help determine how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project success overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on project objectives taking into account individual risks when a risk event occurs it is no longer uncertain threats that occur may be called issues or problems while opportunities that occur may be called benefits both issuesproblems and benefits entail project management actions that are outside the scope of the project risk management process risk management allows for synergies and efficiencies by addressing both risks and opportunities in the same analyses and coordinating responses if they overlap or can reinforce each other risk management is an important component of project management program and portfolio management and project governance it involves assessing the overall project risk which is the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome and is more than the sum of individual risks on a project effective risk management is necessary for setting realistic targets for cost and duration establishing contingency reserve levels setting project priorities and judging whether the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances stakeholder risk attitudes play a crucial role in risk management these attitudes are influenced by a range of factors including the scale of the project public commitments made about the project and sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts and industrial relations stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased certainty in project outcomes and may express a preference for one project objective over another an organizations culture also strongly influences how risk is regarded understanding stakeholders attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning that precedes risk identification and analysis risk management in projects involves proactively and deliberately managing stakeholders attitudes towards risk which can vary between projects stakeholders and even stages of the same project the process of risk management should be iterative and progressive with the identification analysis and response to risks repeated and plans updated throughout the projects lifetime this is because circumstances and available information about risks can change as the project progresses effective risk management relies heavily on communication and comprehensive risk identification and analysis reviews and updates to the risk management process should be frequent and indepth depending on the projects nature the volatility of the environment and the timing of other project management reviews and updates risk management involves input from stakeholders in a project to ensure that risks are realistically assessed effective and honest communication from the project risk management process to stakeholders is crucial with communication targeted to meet the specific needs of each stakeholder and reflected in the project communications strategy each stakeholders responsibility and role in risk management should be identified and agreed upon project risk management should be an integral part of all other project processes with anyone with an interest in achieving project objectives playing a role in risk management roles and responsibilities for project risk management should be clearly defined communicated and with individuals held responsible and accountable for results responsibility should also be allocated for ensuring that riskrelated lessons are learned the project manager is responsible for the daytoday management of a project including effective risk management their role includes determining acceptable levels of risk for the project in consultation with stakeholders developing and approving the risk management plan promoting the risk management process for the project facilitating open communication about risk within the project team and with management and other stakeholders participating in all aspects of the risk management process approving risk responses and associated actions prior to implementation applying project contingency funds to deal with identified risks that occur during the project overseeing risk management by subcontractors and suppliers regularly reporting risk status to key stakeholders with recommendations for appropriate strategic decisions and actions to maintain acceptable risk exposure escalating identified risks to senior management where appropriate monitoring the efficiency and effectiveness of the risk management process auditing risk responses for their effectiveness and documenting lessons learned project risk management involves identifying analyzing and responding to project risks to meet the projects objectives project risk management is an integral part of project management and a critical success factor for project success it should not be viewed as an optional process or additional overhead task but clearly integrated with other project management processes the outputs of project risk management can impact estimating resource requirements cost or duration assessing the impact of scope changes planning or replanning the project allocating resources and reporting progress to stakeholders project management process effectiveness is increased by using the information and results from project risk management risk management in project management requires inputs from other processes including the work breakdown structure estimates project schedule and assumptions list the project risk management process involves defined steps to understand and manage risk with each step being scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk scalable elements include resources methodology tools and techniques supporting infrastructure review and update frequency and reporting requirements the process always starts with an initiation step to ensure a common understanding and agreement among the team and stakeholders on the approach and parameters that will be applied a clear understanding of risk thresholds and a framework for assessing identified risks is essential for a successful project risk management implementation risks only exist in relation to project objectives and it is essential to clearly define these objectives at the start of the risk management process project risk management involves defining objectives scaling risk management activities based on the project and establishing risk thresholds and tolerances the initial step should be documented communicated reviewed by stakeholders and formally approved after agreeing on the scope and objectives risks should be identified distinguishing them from nonrisks a variety of risk identification techniques are available and input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders historical records and project files can be useful in risk identification the risk identification process should be iterative to account for emergent risks risk management involves identifying risks in documents recording them and designating a risk owner to manage each risk after identification the importance of each risk is evaluated to prioritize them evaluate the overall project risk and determine appropriate responses risk evaluation can be done using qualitative techniques to consider individual risks quantitative techniques to evaluate the overall effect of risk on the project outcome or a combination of both qualitative techniques help understand individual risks by considering characteristics such as probability of occurrence degree of impact on project objectives manageability timing of possible impacts relationships with other risks common causes or effects etc the results from qualitative assessments should be documented communicated to key project stakeholders and used to determine appropriate responses quantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identified risks on the project outcome taking into account probabilistic or projectwide effects such as correlation between risks interdependency and feedback loops thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project the results of quantitative analysis should be used to focus the development of risk management strategies risk management involves developing appropriate responses to individual risks which have been prioritized and evaluated for overall project risk exposure a range of strategies can be used for both threats and opportunities and the risk owner should select a suitable strategy based on the risks characteristics and priority the strategy should be achievable affordable costeffective and appropriate actions should be defined to implement the chosen strategy which may be delegated to action owners the effectiveness of these actions should be monitored and any secondary risks identified should be managed in addition to individual risk responses actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk all response strategies and actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the project plan it is essential that agreedupon actions are implemented and the project risk management process should be repeated at regular intervals throughout the projects life to reevaluate the status of previously identified risks and identify any emergent risks contingency reserve levels should be calculated and documented to inform subsequent actions quantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk the relevant information about risk management from the section includes the project risk management process consists of several steps plan risk management identify risks perform qualitative risk analysis perform quantitative risk analysis plan risk responses and monitor and control risks the purpose of plan risk management is to define the scope and objectives of the risk management process and ensure its integration into wider project management the identify risks step involves identifying as many knowable risks as possible the perform qualitative risk analysis step evaluates the key characteristics of individual risks to prioritize them for further action the perform quantitative risk analysis step evaluates the combined effect of risks on the overall project outcome the plan risk responses step determines appropriate response strategies and actions for individual and overall project risks and integrates them into a project management plan the monitor and control risks step implements agreedupon actions reviews changes in project risk exposure identifies additional risk management actions as required and assesses the effectiveness of the project risk management process figure shows the flow of control and information between the various steps within the project risk management process the plan risk management process aims to develop the overall risk management strategy for a project and decide how risk management processes will be executed it involves integrating project risk management with all other project management activities a risk management plan is essential for effective risk management describing how risk management processes should be carried out and their relationships with other project management processes and organizational management processes initial risk management planning should be done early in the projects overall planning with risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan the risk management plan should include a budget for specific risk management activities in terms of resources cost and time the cost of treating risks should be included in the project budget and the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated allocated and managed additionally the plan will define monitoring methods to track corresponding expenditures and conditions for modifying the approved budget for risk management risk management activities need to be repeated throughout the project and integrated into the project management plan the risk management plan should define the normal frequency for repeating risk management processes and specify exceptional conditions for initiating corresponding actions success criteria for risk management include both projectrelated and processrelated measures projectrelated criteria for assessing the success of project risk management include agreement on an acceptable level of results for projectrelated objectives such as cost time and scope with reference to project definition documents stakeholders should prioritize each project objective to provide guidance in risk management particularly in prioritizing risk responses processrelated criteria for success in project risk management depend on factors such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project the level of risk considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of relevant stakeholders which may be influenced by the organization and individual stakeholders risk management involves identifying factors that affect a project and determining their inherent tolerance for uncertainty and relative importance of specific project objectives this information should be considered when setting thresholds and applying risk management processes guidelines for escalating riskrelated information should reflect the risk attitudes and expectations of stakeholders and the project manager should communicate effectively with stakeholders as the project evolves to stay aware of any changes in their attitudes it is important for all participants to have a shared understanding of risk terms and for critical values and thresholds to be defined consistently with the project scope and stakeholder attitudes qualitative analysis should define terms such as high impact or medium probability objectively and the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required for quantitative analysis or decisionmaking in risk response planning or monitoring and control risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed provide a template for the risk register and indicate the intensity of effort and frequency of risk management processes based on project characteristics and risk management objectives the risk management plan outlines the projects risk management roles and responsibilities specifying the criteria for determining success level of authority and actions to be taken by the project team and stakeholders it defines communication principles for both internal team communication and external communication between the team and stakeholders the plan sets expectations for the structure content and frequency of risk management meetings reports and routine documents as well as information sharing for escalation or exceptional events critical success factors for the plan risk management process include acceptance by stakeholders alignment with internal and external project constraints balance between cost or effort and benefit completeness with respect to the needs of the project risk management process identification and addressing barriers to successful project risk management risk management is important for a management process to be successful and it should be viewed as a skill separate from general project management a clear definition of project objectives and a highlevel view of the project environment are necessary for risk management the project manager should ensure that valid definition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity an organization may need to develop its own risk management approach or tailor a proprietary approach organizational process assets that can contribute to the success of the plan risk management activities include standard templates predefined risk categories and an established project management methodology with risk management procedures access to relevant lessons learned can also be helpful the risk management plan will only be effective if project risk management is carried out as an integral part of the project with corresponding activities built into the project work breakdown structure and included in the project schedule budget and workassignment documents it is important to involve project stakeholders in project risk management the project manager should involve stakeholders in the plan risk management process to build their skills and understanding and ensure their commitment approval of risk management resources specified in the risk management plan should be obtained from management at an adequate level management should be involved in analyzing the level of resourcing required and accept the risks associated with specific limitations placed on resource provision disagreements between stakeholders on risk tolerance and evaluation measures should be addressed and resolved risk management planning should comply with the organizations objectives policies and practices the plan should be compatible with the organizations culture capabilities values goals and objectives it should also consider relevant organizational procedures and enterprise environmental factors such as strategic risk management or corporate governance processes planning sessions are recommended to build a common understanding of the projects risk approach and gain agreement on risk management techniques the elaboration of the risk management plan can help develop an effective means for the team to work together the plan risk management process involves assigning and accepting initial risk responsibilities methodology templates terms definitions time schedules and cost budgets for other project risk management processes the tools and parameters to be used in subsequent processes should be specified and documented in the risk management plan it is important to consider relevant existing templates for work products such as risk status reports risk breakdown structures or the risk register and adapt them as necessary for the project the results of risk management planning are documented in the risk management plan which provides stakeholders with a common view of how riskrelated activities will be handled stakeholder responsibilities and key areas of focus the participants in this process should include the project manager selected project team members other stakeholders members of the broader organization having responsibility for risk and other subject matter experts or facilitators as needed a risk management plan for a project includes risk management methodology risk management organization roles responsibilities and authority stakeholder risk tolerance risk management tools and guidelines for use thresholds and corresponding definitions communications plan strategy risk breakdown structure the plan may also include a project description criteria for success templates and a section on the stakeholders risk tolerance the identify risks process is the first step in project risk management and its purpose is to identify all knowable risks to project objectives the process should be initiated as early as possible in the project lifecycle even though uncertainty is high and information may be limited identifying risks early allows key project decisions to consider the risks associated with the project risks may change over time due to internal decisions and actions or external changes and the identify risks process should be iterative to account for new risks that become knowable when a risk is first identified potential responses should also be recorded and considered for immediate action if appropriate critical success factors for the identify risks process include early identification which enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks the practices described in sections through will maximize the value and effectiveness of the identify risks process and enhance the likelihood of identifying as many risks as practicable risk identification is an iterative process that should be carried out throughout the project life cycle including at key milestones or during significant changes to the project or its environment risks can be identified at any time not just during formal identification events or reviews a broad range of sources should be considered to ensure that all potential uncertainties are identified the process should explicitly identify opportunities as well as risks multiple perspectives from a range of project stakeholders should be sought to ensure that all knowable risks are exposed each identified project risk should relate to at least one project objective identifying risks early allows for more time to develop and implement risk responses which can enhance efficiency as responses taken early are often less costly than later ones identifying risks should be done for each project objective taking into account that some risks may affect multiple objectives risk statements should be complete and unambiguous providing detailed descriptions of the uncertainty its causes and effects risks should be described at a level of detail that allows for clear responsibility and accountability of a single risk owner along with the identification of trigger conditions when possible objectivity should be emphasized during the risk identification process with an awareness of potential motivational and cognitive biases sources of bias should be exposed and managed to minimize subjectivity and encourage the identification of all possible risks a range of tools and techniques is available for the risk identification process risk identification involves three categories of techniques historical review this approach is based on past experiences either from the current project similar projects in the same organization or comparable projects in other organizations it requires careful selection of comparable situations and filtering of data to ensure only relevant previous risks are considered current assessments these techniques rely on detailed examination of the current project analyzing its characteristics against given frameworks and models to expose areas of uncertainty unlike historical review current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points creativity techniques these methods encourage project stakeholders to use their imagination to find risks that might affect the project they can be used singly or in groups with varying degrees of structure and depend on the ability of participants to think creatively a skilled facilitator can enhance their success each category has strengths and weaknesses and no single technique can reveal all knowable risks therefore the identify risks process for a particular project should use a combination of these techniques risk management involves a combination of techniques including historical review using a risk identification checklist current assessment such as assumptions analysis and creativity through brainstorming a risk breakdown structure prompt list or set of generic list categories can help ensure that potential risks are thoroughly addressed when identifying risks it is important to describe them clearly and unambiguously using structured risk descriptions and a risk metalanguage that distinguishes risks from their causes and effects this can be achieved using threepart statements in the form as a result of cause risk may occur which would lead to effect the results of the risk identification process should be documented in a risk register which includes a structured risk description the nominated risk owner and may also contain information on the causes and effects of the risk trigger conditions and preliminary responses the perform qualitative risk analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually identified project risks prioritizes risks based on agreedupon characteristics evaluates the probability of each risk and the effect of each risk on project objectives categorizes risks according to their sources or causes to identify common root causes and develop effective risk responses identifies common effects from groups of risks to expose areas of greatest risk exposure eg project completion date budget or a particular deliverables scope provides project management with the characteristics of risks that have the most influence positive or negative on achieving the projects objectives high priority risks that threaten or enhance the achievement of project objectives are a focus in the plan risk responses process and may be further analyzed in the perform quantitative risk analysis process risk analysis process involves a successful qualitative risk analysis with project stakeholder agreement as a fundamental criterion the agreedupon approach forms the basis of the process credibility and agreedupon definitions ensure highquality information collection the process is executed reliably contributing to the credibility of its outputs the risk analysis process includes using an agreedupon approach for all identified risks in a project assessing them based on probability of occurrence and impact on individual objectives considering other factors such as urgency manageability and impact external to the project in determining the importance of a risk urgency is determined by the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the clarity of symptoms and warning signs that may trigger the response manageability is assessed by examining risks and deciding to go forward stop or rescope the project inform the customer of the risks or establish a contingency reserve a risk may increase in importance if it affects the enterprise beyond the project risk assessment should be based on agreedupon definitions of risk terms to ensure consistent use and realistic assessments highquality information about risks is required for effective risk analysis which can be gathered through interviews workshops and expert judgment data gathered may be subject to bias which should be identified and remedied if possible iterative qualitative risk analysis should be performed periodically throughout the project with the frequency determined during the plan risk management process the perform qualitative risk analysis process involves tools and techniques for assessing individual risks and identifying those that are important to the projects success relevant information about risk management qualitative risk analysis tools prioritize risks by defining their importance through agreedupon risk characteristics usually a combination of probability of occurrence and degree of impact on objectives output from these tools is a listing of risks in priority order or groups eg high moderate low data collection and evaluation for individual risks require management support and attention using tools such as interviews workshops and databases of prior projects bias in data gathering should be prevented especially when relying on expert judgment some tools allow prioritizing risks based on their probability and impact on specific objectives providing a list of risks important to a particular objective there is value in constructing a measure of a specific risks importance to the entire project for ease of communication with management and stakeholders a single risk prioritization index can be used in such cases risk management should include creating an index of project risks that reflects the organizations priorities among objectives the method for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented categorizing risks appropriately to improve the analysis of risk probability and magnitude and to identify common root causes or causal chains combining risk analysis results with the risk breakdown structure to show clusters of priority risks from specific sources and with the work breakdown structure to show which areas of the project exhibit the most risk assessing the impact of highpriority risks on specific objectives such as the schedule to determine which activities to address to reduce uncertainty documenting the results of the qualitative risk analysis the perform qualitative risk analysis process involves prioritizing risks by considering their probability of occurrence and potential impact on project objectives or the entire project each identified risk is assigned a priority which is stored in a risk register and shared with project participants responsible for further analysis or action highpriority risks are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are frequently monitored lowpriority risks are placed on a watch list and reviewed less often for changes in their status the perform quantitative risk analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on a projects objectives based on current plans and information when considering risks simultaneously this analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project objectives and to estimate contingency reserves for time and cost appropriate to the risks and risk tolerance of project stakeholders quantitative risk analysis which may use techniques such as monte carlo simulation can provide a more realistic estimate of overall project cost or schedule than a nonprobabilistic approach however it is not always required or appropriate for all projects and may require more effort than qualitative risk analysis the benefits of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure additional insights and value the perform quantitative risk analysis process calculates estimates of overall project risk while specific project risks are usually best understood and quantified at a detailed level such as the lineitem cost or schedule activity level risk management in project management involves specifying project objectives such as budget and schedule at a higher level conducting an overall risk analysis using quantitative techniques to estimate the implication of all quantified risks on project objectives representing the project objectives accurately including the project schedule or cost estimate identifying risks at a detailed level including individual project elements such as schedule activities or lineitem costs and generic risks that have a broader effect applying a quantitative method such as monte carlo simulation or decision tree analysis to determine the overall impact on project objectives by incorporating multiple risks simultaneously comparing the results of the quantitative analysis to the project plan to answer important questions such as what is the probability of meeting the projects objectives how much contingency reserve is needed to provide the organization with the required level of certainty based on its risk tolerance which parts of the project contribute the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quantified risks require more attention the perform quantitative risk analysis process is used to analyze the effects of risks on project objectives using quantitative methods this process is carried out after the identify risks and perform qualitative risk analysis processes have been completed using a prioritized list of identified risks the success of this process depends on factors such as prior risk identification and qualitative risk analysis use of an appropriate project model eg project schedule lineitem cost estimates decision tree commitment to collecting highquality risk data through means such as interviews workshops and expert judgment quantitative risk analysis is sensitive to the completeness and correctness of the project model used the analysis can help distinguish between risks that threaten objectives beyond stakeholder tolerances and those for which the objectives are within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered vigorous risk responses may be targeted at protecting the most important objectives to stakeholders risk management requires resources time and management support recognizing and combating bias in risk analysis data is crucial for success bias can come from cognitive or motivational sources the perform quantitative risk analysis process correctly derives the overall project risk from individual risks using appropriate methods such as monte carlo simulation for cost and schedule risks and decision trees for making decisions under uncertainty risks should be specified at the level of detailed tasks or lineitem costs and incorporated into the project model to calculate effects on objectives like schedule or cost interrelationships between risks should be considered such as risks with common root causes that are likely to occur together these related risks can be addressed by correlating them or attaching the risk or root cause to multiple project elements in the risk register risk management involves quantitative risk analysis which uses tools and techniques with the following characteristics comprehensive risk representation risk models can represent many risks and both opportunities and threats to project objectives simultaneously risk impact calculation quantitative models calculate the effect of risks on project objectives at the total project level quantitative method for analyzing uncertainty probability models are used to handle uncertainty represented predominantly as probability of an events occurring or as probability distributions for a range of outcomes data gathering tools data gathering tools include assessment of historical data workshops interviews or questionnaires to gather quantified information on risks effective presentation of quantitative analysis results quantitative analysis results are not typically available in standard deterministic project management methods the perform quantitative risk analysis process provides the following information about risk management probability of achieving a project objective such as finishing on time or within budget amount of contingency reserve in cost time or resources needed to provide a required level of confidence identity or location within the project model of the most important risks such as sensitivity analysis in a cost risk analysis or a criticality analysis in a schedule risk analysis quantitative risk analysis should be performed periodically throughout the project with the frequency determined during the plan risk management process and dependent on events within the project the results of the perform quantitative risk analysis should be used to modify the project plan including overall project contingency reserve in time and cost if an adjustment in scope is needed scope changes are agreed upon documented and a new quantitative risk analysis is carried out to reflect the new aspects of the project the contingency reserves calculated in risk analysis are incorporated into the cost estimate and schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation for the project contingency reserves may also be used for capturing opportunities if the required contingency reserve exceeds available time or resources changes in the project scope and plan may be necessary the results of the analysis provide urgency to risk response based on the probability of achieving the plans objectives or the amount of contingency reserve required the results are recorded and passed on to the project management team for further actions the plan risk responses process determines effective response actions for individual risks and the overall project risk taking into account stakeholders risk attitudes conventions specified in the risk management plan and any constraints and assumptions the objective of the plan risk responses process is to determine the set of actions that enhances the chances of project success while complying with organizational and project constraints plans should be developed for addressing every risk that is sufficiently important risk management involves identifying and managing risks that may pose a threat or offer an opportunity to a projects objectives it includes agreeing on actions to be taken and potential changes to budget schedule resources and scope that these actions may cause contingent risk response actions should be executed at the optimum time with trigger conditions specified the responsibility for monitoring project conditions and implementing corresponding actions should be clearly assigned to a risk owner who is responsible for ensuring the risk response is effective and planning additional risk responses if required the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring the agreedupon risk responses are carried out as planned in a timely manner responses when implemented can generate additional risks known as secondary risks which need to be analyzed and planned for it is not feasible or desirable to eliminate all threats from a project and there may be residual risks that remain after responses have been implemented these residual risks should be clearly identified analyzed documented and communicated to all relevant stakeholders all approved unconditional actions arising from risk response planning should be integrated into the project risk management is an essential part of project management planning and implementation the following rules should be invoked for risk management project change management and configuration control project planning budgeting and scheduling resource management and project communication planning the plan risk responses process has critical success factors that are important for its success these factors include communication maintaining open and appropriate communication with stakeholders disseminating plans and obtaining approval to ensure full acceptance addressing organizational causes of risks such as culture attitudes or disagreements concerning objectives may require involving high levels of the organizations management and other stakeholders clearly defining riskrelated roles and responsibilities the success of risk response is dependent on the full support and involvement of the project team and other stakeholders key roles include the risk owner and risk action owner a single risk owner should be assigned to every identified risk and each agreedupon risk response should have a single risk action owner the people with corresponding responsibilities should be aware of their expectations and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority of these roles management may take ownership of risks with political or organizational causes risk management involves the following steps riskrelated contingency reserves should be approved and tracked by management agreedupon risk responses should be integrated into the project management plan scheduled and assigned for execution responses that depend on uncertain conditions should be monitored and performed if necessary each response should be planned in detail including estimating resources costs and duration updating the budget and schedule and obtaining approval and commitment from management and risk owners responses may be developed to address risks related by cause and effect or by common root cause risks should be categorized to help identify and address this situation the interaction of risks and responses should be considered including the aggregation of risks and the impact of one risk on the probability or impact of other risks deciding on the response strategy may require compromise as some responses may be mutually exclusive or counterproductive a holistic view of all proposed responses should be taken the section discusses the practice standard for project risk management specifically focusing on planning risk responses here are the key points about risk management the challenge in planning responses to risks is controlling the potential effects of the strategy developed for treating the original risk if overlooked the total level of threat in a project can increase or the potential for opportunities can be compromised responses to risks should be appropriate timely costeffective feasible achievable agreedupon assigned and accepted when assessing a proposed risk response plan consider the following criteria consistency with organizational values project objectives and stakeholder expectations technical feasibility ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding actions balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in the risk profile of the project risk response planning should address both threats and opportunities combining them into a single integrated plan if either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed the combined set of response strategies will be incomplete and potentially invalid risk response planning should be carried out at a general strategic level before developing detailed tactical approaches once the responses have been planned at a strategic level they should be expanded into actions at the tactical level and integrated into the project management plan eg schedule budget and resources risk management involves developing risk response strategies for individual set and projectlevel risks with involvement from affected stakeholders there are four strategies for addressing individual risks avoid a threat or exploit an opportunity this strategy involves taking actions to ensure a threat cannot occur or have no effect or that the project can take advantage of an opportunity transfer a threat or share an opportunity this strategy entails transferring a threat or opportunity to a third party better positioned to address it mitigate a threat or enhance an opportunity this approach identifies actions to decrease the probability andor impact of a threat and increase the probability andor impact of an opportunity accept a threat or an opportunity this strategy applies when other strategies are not feasible and involves taking no action unless the risk occurs in which case contingency or fallback plans may be implemented risk management strategies for overall project risk include canceling the project if the level of risk remains unacceptable sharing the risk with the customer and supplier replanning the project by modifying project priority resource allocations and delivery calendar pursuing the project despite a risk exposure that exceeds the desired level tools and techniques for the plan risk responses process are divided into four categories creativity tools to identify potential responses decisionsupport tools for determining the optimal potential response strategy implementation techniques to turn a strategy into action tools to transfer control to the monitor and control risks process planning risk responses involves identifying potential responses using subject matter experts and creativity techniques evaluating the potential effects of the various options on the projects objectives selecting the best possible response using decisionsupport techniques risk management involves identifying risks performing quantitative risk analysis and planning risk responses this iterative process continues until all individual risks are acceptable and within a predefined threshold action planning is used to turn chosen strategies into concrete actions and integrate them into existing plans these actions can be unconditional or contingent on a trigger condition ownership and responsibility assignment is crucial in risk management a owner must be assigned for each risk and for each response action and they are responsible for managing the risk and carrying out the corresponding risk response in a timely and effective manner trigger conditions should be included in contingency response strategies and monitored for the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event in planning risk responses measurable criteria for success of the response should be included risk action owners should monitor their assigned risks take agreedupon actions as required and provide the risk owners with relevant information on status or changes to the risk characteristics risk owners are responsible for assessing the effectiveness of risk management actions deciding if additional actions are needed and keeping the project manager informed the process of planning risk responses is based on information from the risk register which is updated regularly with responserelated information for each risk interested stakeholders should be able to access risk information to manage risks according to the risk response plan the set of residual risks and their priorities are identified and recorded in the risk register when developing the risk response plan the project management plan is modified to include costs resource assignments scheduling details and changes to project documentation these changes must be formally approved before risk response planning can be considered complete once the risk responses are defined and integrated into the project management plan the individual and overall residual risks are evaluated to determine if additional response planning is required this evaluation provides an estimate of the expected postresponse situation the monitor and control risks process aims to track identified risks monitor residual risks and identify new risks it also ensures that risk response plans are executed at the appropriate time and evaluated for effectiveness throughout the project life cycle the process involves reviewing and updating the effectiveness of all project risk management processes to provide improvements for the current and future projects action owners are responsible for monitoring trigger conditions and executing corresponding actions in a timely manner all approved unconditional response actions should be included and defined in the project management plan the first action of risk monitoring and controlling is to check if this is the case and take appropriate action if necessary this ensures that agreedupon actions are carried out within the normal project execution the risk owners and risk action owners need to be informed of any changes that affect their responsibilities and effective communication should be maintained between them and the project manager for timely implementation of risk responses the plan risk responses process includes a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness of risk responses the risk owner should be kept updated on the status of response actions and decide when the risk has been effectively dealt with regular risk reassessment should be conducted as the project progresses including risk identification analysis and response planning in response to project events or at reasonable intervals reasons for risk reassessment include the occurrence of major or unexpected risks analysis of complex change requests phase end reviews project replanning or major plan elaboration and periodic reviews to ensure that the information remains current in the event of major organizational changes risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to reassessing the risks regular audits should be performed to determine strengths and improve risk management the section discusses the importance of analyzing risk management processes in projects with a focus on longterm process improvements this includes identifying barriers to effectiveness or keys to success in risk management as well as considering appropriate levels of resources adequate time for analysis use of tools and level of detail at the end of a project a description of the closure of every risk in the risk register should be given including whether the risk did not occur occurred and the contingency plan was invoked or occurred and had an impact on the project scope time cost and quality an audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with specific information with respect to the projects experience of risks and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization should be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them this can lead to an update to the corresponding organizational process assets critical success factors for the monitor and control risks process include maintaining risk awareness throughout the project and integrating risk monitoring and control with project monitoring and control the project management plan should include actions for monitoring and controlling project risk which are set up in the early planning cycle and adjusted as needed these actions should be included in the project schedule and tracked during execution risk trigger conditions should be continuously monitored by the risk action owner in collaboration with the risk owner and under the authority of the project manager risk management reports should be regularly included in status meeting agendas to maintain risk awareness among team members and ensure integration into project management decisions regular reports on risks and planned responses should be provided to seniorlevel sponsors to keep stakeholders informed and demonstrate seniorlevel interest in project risk management when risks occur it is crucial to handle them effectively and communicate information about the events to stakeholders as their perception of risk management effectiveness is influenced by the way risks are managed relevant information about risk management communication about the event progress and effectiveness of risk responses should be regular honest and adapted to the needs of each stakeholder this should be supported by a wellexecuted communications plan risk monitoring and controlling requires a focus on tools that support its key success factors for tracking overall risk and individual risks tools are needed for managing contingency reserves including time buffers and cost to assess whether they provide the required level of confidence in the success of the project tools are required to identify trends and forecast future outcomes to determine whether reserves will remain sufficient tools are needed for tracking progress and spending in a consolidated manner tools are required to evaluate and track trigger conditions against the project baseline or specified thresholds based on actual status tools are needed to determine whether risk responses are having the expected effect on the projects overall level of risk relevant information about risk management to monitor the execution of riskrelated plans and processes quality metrics such as degree of variation from the baseline should be tracked and recorded these metrics should have been defined in the risk management plan the results of the monitor and control risks process should include the recording of significant risk management information from the start to finish of the project this information should be stored in a previously specified mechanism and will be used for the lessons learned process relevant information to be recorded includes whether each identified risk or type of risk occurred and if so when and how often relevant data about each risk impact effectiveness of detection and response and any unplanned additional actions taken effectiveness of avoidance exploitation transfer sharing mitigation and enhancement actions information about unexpected or undocumented risks that occurred occurrence of accepted threats or opportunities consolidated information on the level of effort expended costs and benefits to the project of risk management activities this information should be archived and indexed in a way that facilitates retrieval for easy review during the project at closure and for future projects a pmi practice standard for project risk management provides guidelines on the mechanics of the risk management process including what risk management is and does why it is significant how to perform it when it should be performed risk management is a significant process that is applicable for most projects most of the time within the project management community it includes information on inputs tools and techniques and outputs for risk identification analysis response planning and monitoring and control examples and best practices can support the understanding and implementation of the risk management process processes that are specific to certain industries countries or companion professions may be included as an appendix or considered as an extension practice standard relevant information about risk management risk management practices should include discussions of strengths and weaknesses of examples or templates examples should be aligned with relevant information in standards or appendices and placed in proximity to that information practice standards should be written in a consistent style and format practice standards will be aligned with or reference other relevant practice standards practice standards will be consistent with the pmbok guide fourth edition and will be more prescriptive than the guide the section discusses the development of the practice standard for project risk management

clear complete and relevant information on project risk management that is recognized as good practice the standard includes processes unique to project risk management and examplestemplates of specific project risk management processes tools andor techniques in an appendix it is written for project management practitioners and other stakeholders and has been reviewed and updated by the practice standard for project risk management project team the standard uses the pmbok guide third edition glossary as the starting point for terminology risk management is not practiced well on many projects so a project team aimed to identify and apply best practices the project core team for developing the risk management standard consisted of dr david hillson pmp kik piney and kris persun the scope of the risk management standard was expanded to be consistent with the pmbok guide fourth edition the standard was submitted as an exposure draft and received comments with a comment acceptance rate of the final draft of the standard was submitted to the pmi standards program consensus body for official ballot the practice standard for project risk management was developed by a team of

vitello standards project specialist nan wolfslayer astd standards compliance specialist additional significant contributors included jeannette horne the team also included individuals who participated in the development of the standard the practice standard for project risk management outlines guidelines for project teams to manage risks effectively it provides a structured and organized approach to identify analyze and respond to project risks the standard emphasizes the importance of integrating risk management into all phases of the project lifecycle and making it a shared responsibility among the project team members the standard defines risk as an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives such as scope schedule cost or quality risk management involves the processes of risk identification analysis response planning and monitoring and control risk identification involves determining which risks might affect the project and documenting their characteristics risk analysis involves evaluating the probability of occurrence and the impact of each identified risk response planning involves developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to project objectives monitoring and control involve tracking identified risks analyzing risk performance and taking corrective action as necessary the standard also provides guidance on risk management planning which involves defining how risk management will be implemented on the project the plan should include the projects risk management strategy roles and responsibilities reporting and documentation and resources the standard emphasizes the importance of communication in risk management including the communication of risk information to stakeholders and the documentation of riskrelated decisions and actions it also highlights the need for a riskaware culture where project team members are encouraged to identify analyze and manage risks proactively overall the practice standard for project risk management provides a comprehensive framework for project teams to manage risks effectively ensuring that projects are delivered on time within budget and to the required quality standards the text provided does not contain a section on risk management however i can provide you with some general information about risk management risk management is an essential process in project management which involves identifying assessing and prioritizing risks to minimize their impact on project objectives it includes risk identification identifying potential risks that may affect the project risk analysis evaluating the probability and impact of identified risks risk prioritization ranking risks based on their potential impact and likelihood risk response planning developing strategies to mitigate avoid transfer or accept risks risk monitoring and control tracking risks throughout the project lifecycle and adjusting risk response plans as needed effective risk management helps project managers make informed decisions allocate resources wisely and increase the likelihood of project success the text provided appears to be a list of individuals who contributed to the practice standard for project risk management however there are a few pieces of information related to risk management the document is the practice standard for project risk management which suggests that it provides guidelines and best practices for managing risks in projects some of the contributors have credentials related to risk management such as pmp project management professional mcse microsoft certified systems engineer cmc certified management consultant and capm certified associate in project management these credentials indicate that these individuals have expertise in project management and risk management the appendix includes a section for final exposure draft reviewers and contributors which implies that there was a draft version of the practice standard that was reviewed and commented on by experts in the field of risk management this process helps to ensure that the final version of the practice standard is robust comprehensive and relevant to practitioners the document appears to be a list of contributors to the practice standard for project risk management by the project management institute pmi the standard itself provides guidance on risk management practices for projects risk management is the process of identifying analyzing and responding to risks in a projects environment the standard outlines a structured approach to risk management including risk management planning developing a plan for identifying analyzing and responding to project risks risk identification identifying potential risks in the projects environment qualitative risk analysis prioritizing risks based on their probability of occurrence and impact on the project quantitative risk analysis estimating the financial impact of identified risks risk response planning developing responses to identified risks risk monitoring and control monitoring risks and implementing risk response plans as needed the standard also covers topics such as risk management tools and techniques risk management documentation and the role of the project manager in risk management the relevant information about risk management from the provided section is that it is a practice standard for project risk management developed by the project management institute pmi the staff contributors

standard additionally steven l fahrenkrog amanda freitick ruth anne guerrero donn greenberg roberta storer and barbara walsh are also acknowledged for their contributions however the specific details about their contributions to risk management are not provided in this section the following is the relevant information about risk management from the provided section the practice standard for project risk management lists many tools and techniques for supporting project risk management processes including risk management planning the strengths weaknesses and critical success factors csfs for effective application are provided for each technique for risk management planning the following techniques are listed planning meetings and analysis strengths involvement of core team members weaknesses depends on the experience of participants csfs for effective application prior risk management plan templates prior stakeholder analysis existing organizational guidelines for risk management the risk management plan purpose and typical content the risk management plan includes some or all of the following elements depending on the size and complexity of the project purpose typical content note the provided section does not explain the tools and techniques but lists them with certain important characteristics those interested in learning more are encouraged to seek other sources such as handbooks textbooks or courses in project risk management risk management scope and objectives definition of criteria for unacceptable threats and unmissable opportunities impact

templates and typical agenda for status meetings a standard structure for risk description using a risk statement with the format because of one or more causes risk might occur which would lead to one or more effects risk prioritization and selection guidelines should be linked to project objectives and may include numerical weights to create a single weighted sum over all objectives for each risk identify risks technique is used to develop a comprehensive list of all knowable uncertainties that could affect the projects objectives techniques examples and templates for identify risks include analysis which has strengths in simplicity but may have assumptions and constraints risk management can be based on assumptions and constraints listed in the project charter it is important to have a comprehensive list of these assumptions and constraints as implicit or hidden ones are often missed brainstorming can be a useful technique for generating projectspecific risks as it allows all participants to speak their mind and contribute to the discussion however it can be prone to groupthink and other group dynamics and may produce biased results if dominated by a strong person attendance of a representative group of stakeholders commitment to honesty preparation good facilitation and use of structure can assist in effective brainstorming cause and effect ishikawa diagrams can promote structured thinking and effectively select critical impacts through the use of sensitivity analysis however the diagram can quickly become overcomplex checklists can capture previous experience and present a detailed list of risks but they can also grow to become unwieldy and may only include threats missing opportunities regular maintenance is required and use of structure can assist delphi technique can capture input from technical experts and remove sources of bias but it is limited to technical risks and dependent on the actual expertise of experts it may take longer time due to iterations of the experts inputs effective facilitation and clear definition of scope is required it exposes detailed projectspecific risks and requires no specialist tools but it is limited to risks contained in the project risk management involves the use of tools and techniques to understand and estimate the overall reliability of a project some of the relevant risk management techniques mentioned are fmeafault tree analysis chapter force field analysis influence diagrams expose key risk drivers requires disciplined thinking not always easy to determine appropriate structure identify key areas to address interviews address risks in detail generates engagement of stakeholders time consuming raises nonrisks concerns issues worries etc so requires filtering good interviewing and questioning skills environment of trust openness confidentiality preparation open relationship between interviewer and interviewee nominal group technique encourages and allows all participants to contribute allows for different levels of competence in common language to a large extent autodocumenting provides ideal base for affinity diagramming grouping by risk categories for use in the risk breakdown these techniques can help in understanding the relevance of prior experience focusing on threats and capturing previous experience to allow benchmarking against external organizations however they may require expert tools and detailed descriptions of the area being assessed as well as statistically accurate data on fault probabilities they may also be timeconsuming and complex to apply industry knowledge and access to relevant information are also important for effective risk management risk management involves structure and root cause analysis this process can be frustrating for dominant members who feel it is moving slowly it is important to brief all participants and strictly facilitate the technique postproject reviews lessons learned and historical information can be leveraged see chapter this process enhances organizational process assets by preventing the same mistakes or missing the same opportunities twice however information is frequently incomplete and wellstructured project lessons learned databases as well as participation of previous project team members are encouraged prompt lists these ensure coverage of all types of risk and stimulate creativity the choice of list should be relevant to the project and its environment questionnaire this encourages broad thinking to identify risks but its effectiveness depends on the quality of the questions and it is limited to the topics covered by the questions risk breakdown structure rbs this offers a framework for other risk identification techniques such as brainstorming and ensures coverage of all types of risk it tests for blind spots or omissions allows identification of additional dependent risks and forms the basis for development of preemptive and comprehensive responses it can serve to reduce apparent complexity most risk management techniques are organized by risk category and rbs is one such method rootcause analysis this allows identification of additional dependent risks and allows the organization to identify risks that may be related because of their common root causes it forms the basis for development of preemptive and comprehensive responses relevant information about risk management individual risk management in an organization may oversimplify and hide the existence of other potential causes there may be no valid strategy available for addressing the root cause once it has been identified it is important to identify if a risk is an outcome of a more fundamental cause and for management to be willing to address the root cause rather than adopting partial workarounds swot analysis ensures equal focus on both threats and opportunities offering a structured approach to identify threats and opportunities it focuses on internally generated risks arising from organizational strengths and weaknesses and tends to produce highlevel generic risks not projectspecific good facilitation and strict adherence to the technique are necessary to avoid confusing the four swot perspectives system dynamics as a risk management technique exposes unexpected interrelations between project elements generates counterintuitive insights and produces overall impacts of all included events and risks however it requires specialized software and expertise to build models and focuses on impacts but has difficulty including the concept of probability the understanding of feedback competence in applying tools and the quality of the system model are crucial factors in the effective application of this technique accuracy of input data collected for the specific project is also important note csfs for effective application refers to critical success factors for effective application wbs review ensures that all elements of the project scope are considered and provides for risks related to different levels of detail risk management techniques include assumptions and constraints analysis this technique involves identifying assumptions and constraints for the project testing them by asking if they could be false and if so whether project objectives would be affected if both answers are yes a risk is generated brainstorming this technique is commonly used in a facilitated workshop to identify risks it is often structured using risk categories or a risk breakdown structure and may include evaluation of proposed risks to remove nonrisks cause and effect ishikawa diagrams this technique presents in diagrammatic form the causes that contribute to a given outcome to use this technique for risk identification the outcome should be stated as an effect on a project objective ie the impact of a risk risk management involves identifying risks which are uncertain events that could result in an impact when identifying risks it is important to distinguish between risks and issues where issues are certain causes of the impact there are several techniques for risk identification including cause and effect ishikawa diagrams this technique involves identifying the main causes of a risk effect such as staff leaving the project and the causes of those causes such as environment ambition career prospects satisfaction remuneration checklists checklists can be compiled based on previous project experience and can be structured around a risk breakdown structure they should include both threats and opportunities delphi technique this method uses a facilitated anonymous polling of subject matter experts to identify risks in their area of expertise the experts responses are circulated without attribution allowing them to revise their contributions based on those of others this process often generates a consensus of the experts in a few iterations document review risks can be identified through careful review of project documentation including the project charter statement of work contract terms and conditions subcontracts and technical specifications regulatory documents and other projectrelated documents should also be reviewed to identify potential risks risk management relevant information failure modes and effects analysis fmea or fault tree analysis can be used to identify elements that can cause system failure and the probability of failure it can indicate where the system can be made more reliable and is useful in the design and engineering phase of the project fmeafault tree analysis identifies various elements that can cause system failure by themselves or in combination with others based on the logic of the system it can be adapted for risk identification by analyzing how risk impacts might arise force field analysis is typically used in the change management context but can be adapted for risk identification it identifies driving forces forces for change and restraining forces forces against change which currently affect achievement of a project objective risks can then be identified as uncertain events or conditions which would lead to a change in the strength of one or more of the identified forces an example of a fault tree analysis and a force field analysis are provided relevant information about risk management industry knowledge base similar to a checklist it is used for risk identification no templates or examples are presented influence diagrams a diagrammatic representation of a project situation that shows main entities decision points uncertainties and outcomes it can help identify risks when combined with sensitivity analysis or monte carlo simulation an example is provided interviews risk identification interviews should include all main stakeholders and be conducted by an independent skilled interviewer using a structured agenda a risk breakdown structure checklist or prompt list can be used as a framework no templates or examples are presented nominal group technique an adaptation of brainstorming where participants share and discuss all issues before evaluation with each participant participating equally in evaluation no templates or examples are presented postproject reviewslessons learnedhistorical information relevant information to risks for a current project can be obtained by reviewing databases of risks from previous similar situations such as postproject reviews lessons learned exercises or historical information repositories no templates or examples are presented prompt lists a set of risk categories used for risk identification no templates or examples are presented risk identification in project management can be stimulated using prompt lists such as pestle political economic social technological legal environmental tecop technical environmental commercial operational political and spectrum sociocultural political economic competitive technology regulatorylegal uncertaintyrisk market these lists can be used as a framework for techniques like brainstorming and risk interviews a risk identification questionnaire can be presented in a checklist format with possible risks shown in question format or used to present headings from a prompt list the risk breakdown structure rbs is a hierarchical framework of potential sources of risk to a project which can be generic or projectspecific it provides a comprehensive view of the projects risk areas root cause analysis seeks to identify basic causes of risks to a project aiming to address the source of the problem rather than just the symptoms root cause analysis is a risk identification technique that can help identify more fundamental forces behind visible risks it can also lead to broadreaching risk response strategies by identifying common sources of risks when using this technique it is important to distinguish between risks uncertain causes of impact and issues certain causes of impact swot analysis is another risk identification technique that identifies four characteristics of a given situation strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats this technique is commonly used in strategic decision making and can be adapted for risk identification by interpreting the four perspectives as they relate to the organization conducting the project swot analysis is particularly useful for identifying internallygenerated risks arising from within the organization system dynamics sd is a risk identification technique that represents entities and relationships between them in a project situation it is a particular application of influence diagrams and can be used to identify risks within a project situation risk management information from the section includes system dynamics sd analysis can help identify feedback loops that lead to uncertainty or instability in a project and can show the impact of risk events on overall project results such as cost or schedule sensitivity to specific events some of which may be risks can also be indicated through changes in the sd model or assumptions the work breakdown structure wbs can be used as a framework for risk identification techniques such as brainstorming risk interviews checklists or prompt lists perform qualitative risk analysis prioritizes risks for further analysis or handling based on their priority often indicated by their probability and impact characteristics organizations tend to apply resources to those designated as high risk techniques for perform qualitative risk analysis include root cause analysis which addresses both the degree of uncertainty and the effect of a risk on project objectives however it can be difficult to calibrate if there is no historical database of similar events note csfs stands for critical success factors which are the essential areas of activity that must be performed well if the project is to succeed relevant information about risk management agreed definitions of probability and impacts should reflect stakeholders risk tolerances and thresholds values used in the definitions should represent the same level of impact across objectives as perceived by the organizations management or project stakeholders consistent use of these definitions across all identified risks is necessary probability and impact matrix pi matrix allows the organization to prioritize project risks for further analysis or risk response reflecting the organizations level of risk tolerance effective estimation of impact and likelihood is essential organizations should carefully assess the combinations of probability and impact that qualify a risk as low moderate or high risk ensuring the method used reflects the organizations risk attitude definitions used to designate the levels of impact l m h for each objective should represent the same level of impact as perceived by the organizations management or project stakeholders reflecting the organizations utility function the practice standard for project risk management discusses the analytic hierarchy process ahp as a method to develop a relative weighting for project objectives reflecting the organizations priorities for time cost scope and quality ahp helps create an overall project priority list of risks based on their priority with respect to individual objectives however organizational decisions are often made by committees and individuals may not agree on relative priority among objectives it can be difficult to gather information about pairwise comparison of the objectives from highlevel management agreement by management on the usefulness of developing a consistent set of priorities among objectives and the use of proper method or available ahp software are crucial rootcause analysis is another technique mentioned in the section with more details provided in chapter the probability of a risk occurring can be specified in several ways including assigning levels of risk probability by ranges of probability this approach allows subject matter experts to assess a risks probability within a range rather than as a specific value impact level definitions are very projectspecific and the values used to specify the level of impact should be higher as threats or opportunities move from very low to very high for a specific objective levels are defined by the organization as causing the same amount of pain or gain to the project for each level across objectives if a risks possible impact is uncertain and could be assigned to more than one level the organization should define how to handle such situations the section discusses risk management with a focus on qualitative risk analysis when assessing the impact of a risk the analyst may assign it to the corresponding impact level based on the expected or average impact if the impact level is uncertain extra analysis can be conducted to narrow down the range of uncertainty impact level definitions should be tailored to fit the specific project and can be used for both opportunities and threats the section also introduces the probability and impact pi matrix which is used to assess a risks priority based on the combination of probability and impact on a project objective risks are sorted into high moderate or lowrisk classes using the pi matrix the analytic hierarchy process ahp is mentioned as a method for calibrating preferences for achieving the different objectives of a project it helps determine the relative weighting of project objectives such as time cost quality and scope in summary the section focuses on qualitative risk analysis introducing the use of impact level definitions the probability and impact matrix and the analytic hierarchy process for risk management the analytic hierarchy process ahp is a method used to determine the relative weighting of project objectives reflecting their priority to stakeholders or management this prioritization is useful for determining how tradeoffs affecting different objectives will be decided and for creating a project risk priority list ahp can be implemented using specialized software or a spreadsheet perform quantitative risk analysis seeks to determine the overall risk to project objectives when all risks potentially operate simultaneously on the project it provides answers to several questions such as the likelihood of completing the project on schedule or within budget the reliability of the projects product and the amount of contingency needed to provide the organization with a desired level of confidence in the results techniques for perform quantitative risk analysis include decision tree analysis this technique helps analyze decisions under uncertainty by illustrating the possible outcomes and their associated probabilities and values it is useful for evaluating the potential consequences of different decisions and for selecting the best course of action however it can be complex to construct and may require a large amount of data critical success factors for effective application include a clear understanding of the decision and its alternatives accurate probability and value estimates and the ability to handle complex calculations risk management involves the use of decision tree analysis to structure the costs and benefits of decisions under uncertainty the decision tree helps select the decision that provides the highest expected monetary value emv or expected utility to the organization however creating the decision structure and quantifying probabilities can be difficult especially in the absence of historical data the best decision may change with plausible changes in input data and organizations may not make decisions based on a linear emv basis but rather on a nonlinear utility function which can be difficult to specify to effectively apply decision tree analysis it is important to carefully structure the decision tree considering all materially different alternative decisions and specifying it completely access highquality data about probability cost and reward for the decisions and events specified using historical information or judgment of experts use a utility function that has been validated with the organizations decision makers decision tree analysis of complicated situations requires specialized software and there may be resistance to using technical approaches to decisionmaking availability and understanding of the specialized software needed to structure and solve the decision tree are also important emv allows the user to calculate the weighted average expected value of an event that includes uncertain outcomes it is wellsuited to decision tree analysis and incorporates the probabilities of various outcomes to determine the optimal decision risk management involves assessing the probability and impact of uncertain events expected monetary value emv is a calculation used to determine the expected value of uncertain events but it has limitations as it only provides the expected value and may not provide sufficient information for risk decisions emv calculation requires identification of all possible events access to historical data or expert opinions on the values of probability and impact and understanding the difference between emv and the output of simulation tools such as monte carlo analysis monte carlo simulation is a technique used primarily for project schedule and cost risk analysis it allows all specified risks to vary simultaneously calculates quantitative estimates of overall project risk and reflects the reality that several risks may occur together on the project it can provide answers to questions such as the likelihood of the base plan to be successful how much contingency in time and cost is needed and which activities are important in determining the overall project risk however schedules may not be simple and may require significant debugging by an expert scheduler and the quality of input data depends heavily on the expert judgment and the effort and expertise of the risk analyst simulation may also be resisted by management as being unnecessary or too sophisticated compared to traditional project management tools risk management involves the use of specialized software which requires acquisition and learning the input data for this software must include both threats and opportunities for realistic results a good project model is essential which can be created using typical models such as cost estimates and schedules summarylevel models such as project schedules and cost estimates are also used highquality data on risks including the risks impact on project elements uncertain activity durations and uncertain cost elements are necessary for risk management the credibility of the data depends on its quality correct simulation tools and postproject reviewslessons learnedhistorical information are also required decision tree analysis is a risk management technique performed using specialized software the software allows the user to specify the structure of the decision with decision nodes chance nodes costs benefits and probabilities the user can evaluate different decisions using linear utility functions based on expected monetary value emv or on nonlinear utility functions of various shapes emv is a calculation of a value such as weighted average or expected cost or benefit when the outcomes are uncertain risk management involves identifying reasonable alternative outcomes estimating their probabilities and values and calculating the expected monetary value emv monte carlo simulation is a detailed computerintensive approach to determining the value and probability of possible outcomes of a project objective such as schedule or cost it computes the schedule or cost estimate many times using inputs drawn from ranges specified with probability distribution functions the solutions are used to build a histogram of possible project outcomes and their relative probability and cumulative probability it also provides the relative importance of each input in determining the overall project cost and schedule in quantitative schedule risk analysis monte carlo simulation is used to analyze finish dates and an example histogram is provided in figure d in quantitative cost risk analysis it is used to analyze project cost at completion and an example histogram is provided in figure d chapter plan risk responses focuses on developing a set of actions to address the projects risks and integrating them into the project management plan the resulting plan should align with the risk appetites and attitudes of key stakeholders techniques for plan risk responses include brainstorming strengths enables rapid and focused response improves the image of professionalism in project management weaknesses can give a false sense of confidence as if the risk had been avoided trigger conditions must be clearly defined and tracked checklists strengths enables rapid and focused response improves the image of professionalism in project management weaknesses refer to chapter for more details contingency planning strengths ensures actions are available to address significant events before their occurrence provides a rationale for reserves makes the reserve visible and liable to reduction weaknesses can give a false feeling of confidence trigger conditions must be clearly defined and tracked the organization must be willing to execute the plan and provide the budget and resources when the trigger condition occurs contingency reserve estimation strengths provides a rationale for reserves serves as a basis for constructive discussion with sponsors weaknesses the reserve may be reduced arbitrarily policy for reserve management strengths agreed with sponsors and senior management critical chain project management ccpm strengths addresses schedule risk by the addition of feeding buffers to absorb statistical variations on the durations of noncritical path activities reducing their contribution to schedule risk partly mitigates financial risk by controlling the amount of work in process weaknesses not specified in the text relevant information about risk management thresholds can be used as a trigger condition for specific response actions special software is available for creating and managing buffers to deal with predictable common cause variation buffers may be inadequate to cater for special causes indicative start and end dates can disturb conventional management expectations and cause problems for setting intermediate milestones an assumption that base estimates represent confidence levels may not be followed in all variants of risk management tools not all project schedules are fully resourced but a fully resourced project schedule is required for effective risk management understanding and acceptance by management and project team members that activity dates are indicative rather than definite is necessary equitable sharing of the buffers by all team members concerned is required decision tree analysis allows calculation of the expected monetary values of various response options the delphi technique involves selected experts in the risk management process expected monetary value provides an estimate of the potential benefit of a risk response force field analysis suggests where best to apply risk responses industry knowledge base provides standard responses for some risks interviews with experienced practitioners can provide new ideas and act as a devils advocate for potential responses nominal group technique is useful for generating novel risk responses multicriterion selection techniques provide a means of selecting the responses that best support the full set of project objectives risk management involves setting project success criteria and weighting them leveraging previous experience and conducting postproject reviews to learn from historical information it is important to have an agreedupon set of weighted project success criteria for effective risk management risk management techniques include qualitative risk analysis this method can be timeconsuming but is useful for identifying symptoms that can be used as trigger conditions for contingent responses it allows the organization to identify and address the fundamental causes of risks for efficient and effective responses quantitative risk analysis this method provides a means of evaluating the potential effect of the response plans on the overall project risk however it can be too involved or complex for the benefit envisaged it is most effective when used after prior effective qualitative analysis rootcause analysis this technique allows the organization to identify and address the fundamental causes of risks for efficient and effective responses responding at the level of the root cause may effectively address multiple risks scenario analysis this method provides a view of the potential effect of the relevant risk and the corresponding response strategy it forces participants to analyze the effect of any strategy and helps identify secondary risks however it can add to the list of assumptions and can be timeconsuming contingency planning for specific normally highimpact risks the risk owner may choose to assemble a team to develop a response as if the risk had genuinely happened the corresponding plan with supporting information should then be documented and approved at project management or sponsor level this approval must include authorization to deploy the corresponding resources if the predefined trigger conditions arise contingency reserve estimation this involves estimating the cost and schedule reserves necessary to reduce the risk of schedule and cost overruns to a level acceptable to the project stakeholders relevant information about risk management residual risks can affect the schedule budget andor performance objectives of a project an amount should be set aside to allow for these eventualities consisting of two components those to cover specific approved conditional responses eg contingency plans those to address unspecified or passively accepted risks quantitative methods can be used to determine the amounts to be set aside such as decision trees for conditional responses and simulation for unspecified risks these reserves are tracked and managed in monitor and control risks multicriteria selection techniques an adaptation of the perform qualitative risk analysis process based on selection criteria this technique involves calculating the weighted scores of options based on a predefined set of prioritized criteria scenario analysis this method involves defining several plausible alternative scenarios describing and evaluating different risk responses for each scenario and comparing the alternatives if the organization can choose between scenarios if the scenarios are out of the organizations control scenario analysis can lead to effective contingency planning no templates or examples are provided for these techniques monitor and control risks process ensures that risk responses are being applied effectively initiating corrective actions as necessary techniques for monitor and control risks include critical chain project management ccpm uses buffer penetration to trigger actions such as adjusting the relative priority of tasks strengths are the use of buffer to track spend and release contingency amounts as risks expire weaknesses could be an unwarranted focus on cost dimension a wellsized contingency reserve relative to the risk to overall project completion date and budget is a critical success factor reserve analysis provides a means of tracking spend and releasing contingency amounts as risks expire can be applied to schedule reserves strengths are early warning of the need to communicate with sponsor weaknesses could be attention to overall measure of reserve depletion may hide detailed risks accurate sizing of the contingency reserve of time or cost relative to the risk to overall project completion date and budget is a critical success factor risk audits provide a formal assessment of compliance with the risk management plan strengths are a wellspecified risk management plan weaknesses could be disruptive to the project and taken as too judgemental to the project team sensitivity to the burden it places on the project team is a critical success factor risk reassessment forces a review of project risks when necessary so that the risk register remains uptodate strengths are wellmaintained project and risk documentation scheme weaknesses are that it takes time and effort status meetings provide a means of verifying information about the status of risks and maintaining team awareness risk management involves understanding and analyzing risks to determine the effectiveness of earlier responses and potential triggers for responses trend analysis is a technique used in risk management that provides an indication of the effectiveness of earlier responses and can provide trigger conditions for responses however it requires an understanding of significant vs nonsignificant variation and regular reporting and analysis of critical values variance analysis is another technique used in risk management which allows comparison between forecast and actual risk impacts and provides data for earned value analysis it can provide trigger conditions for responses but the values can be taken out of context and may require realistic prior definitions of thresholds for significant variance reserve analysis is an analytical technique used to establish a reserve for the schedule duration budget estimated cost or funds for a project tracking the state of the reserve through project execution provides summary information on the evolution of the status of corresponding risks this information can be useful when reporting up the organization to those responsible for several projects once a corresponding risk occurs or ceases to be current the corresponding reserve needs to be reviewed to assess whether it still provides the agreed level of confidence time buffers can be used in two different ways to provide for accepted schedule risks or as a schedulingrelated technique in critical chain project management ccpm in contrast with the contingency reserve for identified risks the buffers in ccpm provide a shared mechanism for accommodating the natural variability of project activities relevant information about risk management tracking the rate at which activity duration buffers are used during project execution in critical chain project management ccpm provides information on schedule risk and triggers risk management activities risk audits evaluate a if risk management rules are being carried out as specified and b if the risk management rules are adequate for controlling the project risk reassessment ensures effective control by repeating the full risk management cycle as required risks should be on the agenda at all project reviews covering top priority risks at present changes in risks or trigger conditions status of risk action plans effectiveness of actions taken additional actions required risks closed and impact on plans lessons to be added to organizational process assets trend analysis evaluates how the risk profile is changing if previous actions are having the expected effect and if additional actions are required earned value formulae can be used to assess changes with respect to time and cost relevant information about risk management from the provided section variance analysis particularly using earned value analysis formulae cv sv cpi spi can be used to set thresholds for action and indicate the effectiveness of the risk process earned value management systems evms utilize variance from the plan as the basis for forecasts or extrapolations to the cost at completion projections made using evms have been found to be reliable early in the project specifically around into the execution these points highlight the importance of monitoring and analyzing variances in project execution to manage risks effectively using tools such as earned value analysis and evms here is the relevant information about risk management extracted from the section project risk analysis management pram guide second edition by the association for project

management practices assumptions in project management are factors considered to be true without proof and can affect project planning assumptions involve a degree of risk a benefit is a positive effect on a project objective due to the occurrence of an opportunity bias during risk information gathering can inhibit impartial judgment types of bias include cognitive and motivational bias causes are events or circumstances that might give rise to risks consequences are referred to as impacts constraints are restrictions that affect project performance contingency reserve is the amount of funds or time needed above the estimate to reduce the risk of overruns a contingency plan is developed in anticipation of a risk and executed if specific trigger conditions arise decision tree analysis is a method used when future scenarios or outcomes of actions are uncertain it incorporates probabilities costs or rewards of each logical path of events and future decisions and uses expected monetary value analysis to help the organization identify the relative values of each decision risk management is the process of identifying assessing and managing risks in a project a risk is a specific uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on at least one project objective risk can be categorized into emergent risk which is a risk that arises later in a project and could not have been identified earlier and individual risk the process of identifying risks is called identify risks and it involves determining which risks may affect the project and documenting their characteristics impact also known as consequence is a measure of the effect of a risk on one or more objectives if it occurs likelihood also known as probability is the chance that a risk will occur monitor and control risks is the process of implementing risk response plans tracking identified risks monitoring residual risks identifying new risks and evaluating the risk process throughout the project life cycle monte carlo analysis is a technique that computes or iterates the project cost or project schedule many times using input values selected at random from probability distributions of possible costs or durations to calculate a distribution of possible total project cost or completion dates overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole and is more than the sum of individual risks on a project since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual risks opportunity is a condition or situation favorable to the project a positive set of circumstances a positive set of events a risk that will have a positive impact on project objectives or a possibility for positive changes contrast with threat risk management in a project includes identifying and managing risks to increase the probability and impact of positive events and decrease the probability and impact of events adverse to project objectives risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives perform qualitative risk analysis is the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing and combining their probability of occurrence and impact perform quantitative risk analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the effect of identified risks on overall project objectives plan risk management is the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities for a project plan risk responses is the process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce threats to project objectives probability is a measure of how likely an individual risk is to occur also known as likelihood problem is a negative effect on a project objective arising from the occurrence of a threat risk attitude is a chosen mental disposition risk action is a detailed task which implements in whole or in part a response strategy in order to address an individual risk or overall project risk risk action owner is the person responsible for carrying out the approved risk actions for responding to a given risk also known as response owner when the context allows it response strategy is a highlevel approach to address an individual risk or overall project risk broken down into a set of risk actions risk management is an approach to uncertainty that individuals and groups adopt driven by perception and evidenced by behavior it exists on a spectrum with common attitudes being risk averse risk tolerant risk neutral and risk seeking risk breakdown structure rbs is a tool that depicts identified project risks in a hierarchical organization by risk category and subcategory identifying potential risk areas and causes risk categories are groups of potential risk causes such as technical external organizational environmental or project management risk exposure is a measure of overall project risk describing the effect of identified risks on objectives risk management plan is a document that describes how project risk management will be structured and performed it can be informal or formal and contains information on how risks will be identified analyzed and responded to it is different from the risk register which contains the list of project risks analysis results and risk responses risk metalanguage is a structured description of a risk that separates cause risk and effect a risk description using risk metalanguage might be in the form because of cause risk might occur which would lead to effect risk model is a representation of the project including data about project elements and risks which can be analyzed by quantitative methods risk owner is the person responsible for ensuring that risks are managed and addressed an appropriate response strategy is selected and implemented for determining suitable risk actions a risk register is used to document the results of the qualitative and quantitative risk analysis including risk description category cause probability impact proposed responses owners and current status risk threshold is a measure of the level of risk exposure above which action is required and below which risks may be accepted root cause is an initiating cause that gives rise to a causal chain which may give rise to risks secondary risk arises as a direct result of implementing a risk response stakeholders are actively involved in the project and may be affected by its execution or completion and can exert influence over the project and its deliverables threat is an unfavorable condition or situation a negative set of circumstances or a risk that will have a negative impact on a project objective if it occurs trigger condition is the circumstance under which a risk strategy or risk action will be invoked risk management is a comprehensive process that includes risk identification this involves identifying potential risks and their sources which can be done through early identification emergent identification historical review and individual risk plan responses the risk identification process is an iterative one risk representation comprehensive risk representation is crucial for effective risk management constraints constraints such as limitations boundaries and rules need to be considered in risk management contingency plan and reserve plan these are essential risk responses that help in managing uncertainties contingency response strategies are also important qualitative and quantitative risk analysis qualitative analysis involves identifying highimpact risks using creativity techniques data gathering tools and impact analysis quantitative analysis uses numerical data to estimate the probability and impact of risks using methods like decision tree analysis and monte carlo simulation risk management plan a detailed plan outlining the risk management approach objectives and constraints risk monitoring and control regular monitoring and control of risks including current assessments documentation of results and continuous improvement credibility building ensuring the credibility of risk data and information is essential for effective risk management opportunities explicit identification and addressing of opportunities along with threats is necessary for comprehensive risk management highquality risk data and information emphasis on collecting and analyzing highquality data and information for accurate risk analysis level of detail the level of detail in risk management should be appropriate for the projects complexity and importance objectivity maintaining objectivity in risk identification analysis and response is crucial for effective risk management risk management involves several key processes including plan risk management this involves developing a risk management plan which includes processrelated and projectrelated criteria and templates the plan outlines the purpose and objectives of risk management and the roles and responsibilities of team members perform qualitative risk analysis this process involves assessing and categorizing risks as well as building credibility and using an iterative approach perform quantitative risk analysis this process involves reviewing and documenting exposure as well as using tools and techniques to identify and select risk responses plan risk responses this process involves identifying and selecting responses to risks addressing threats and opportunities and ensuring that responses are appropriate timely effective and agreedupon it also involves communication with stakeholders documenting results and specifying timing risk monitoring and control this process involves ongoing monitoring and control of risks as well as ownership and responsibility assignment risk management is a critical component of project management and involves identifying assessing and responding to risks in a proactive and systematic manner it is the responsibility of the project manager to oversee risk management and ensure that it is effectively integrated into the project management plan risk management involves prioritizing risks and their comprehensive representation quantitative risk analysis is appropriate for deriving the overall project risk from individual risks it involves the use of an appropriate project model comparison with qualitative risk analysis and documentation of results highquality risk data is crucial and there should be a commitment to collecting unbiased data interrelationships between risks should be examined risk identification is a critical process that includes the identification of risk causes and effects and the creation of a complete risk statement it should be comprehensive iterative and based on multiple perspectives tools and techniques for risk identification include creativity techniques and historical review risk assessment involves the analysis of risk attitude and awareness risk breakdown structures rbs and categories help in organizing risks response identification selection and strategy are key elements of risk management risk action owners are responsible for planning risk responses risk monitoring and control as well as the documentation and effective presentation of results are also important the risk management plan should include good practices and critical success factors risk management is a crucial part of project management and includes various processes and practices the purpose and objectives of risk management involve identifying assessing and prioritizing risks to ensure the success of the project stakeholder involvement is an essential factor in risk management and communication with stakeholders is crucial risk identification involves determining potential risks that may affect the projects objectives tools and techniques for risk identification include using templates unbiased data and considering the projects schedules threats and uncertainty risk prioritization involves determining the significance of identified risks and their potential impact on the project risk monitoring and control involve tracking and managing overall risk integrating project monitoring and control and maintaining risk awareness tools and techniques for risk monitoring and control include tracking contingency reserves managing trigger conditions and using schematic representations risk response strategies involve developing a plan to address identified risks risk owners are responsible for planning risk responses and managing project risk management the risk register is a critical tool for documenting and tracking risks and risk responses risk threshold refers to the acceptable level of risk for a project interrelationships between risks and the interaction between risks and responses are essential factors to consider in risk management root cause analysis is a technique used to identify the underlying causes of risks quantitative risk analysis involves analyzing risks using numerical data and statistical methods qualitative risk analysis involves analyzing risks using nonnumerical data such as expert judgment roles and responsibilities in risk management include identifying assessing and prioritizing risks developing risk response strategies and monitoring and controlling risks uncertainty and timing are critical factors to consider in risk management
